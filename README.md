# Cystic fibrosis alters the structure of the olfactory epithelium and the expression of olfactory receptors affecting odor perception

# Abstract
A reduced sense of smell is a common condition in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) that negatively
impacts their quality of life. While often attributed to nasal mucosa inflammation, the underlying
causes of the olfactory loss remain unknown. Here, we characterized gene expression in olfactory
epithelium cells from CF patients using single-nuclei RNA sequencing and found altered expression
of olfactory receptors (ORs) and genes related to progenitor cell proliferation. We confirmed these
findings in newborn, inflammation-free samples of a CF animal model, and further identified
ultrastructural alterations in the olfactory epithelium and bulbs of these animals. We established
that CFTR, the anion channel whose dysfunction causes CF, is dispensable for odor-evoked
signaling in sensory neurons, yet CF animals displayed defective odor-guided behaviors consistent
with the morphological and molecular alterations. Our study highlights CF's major role in
modulating epithelial structure and OR expression, shedding light on the mechanisms contributing
to olfactory loss in CF.
